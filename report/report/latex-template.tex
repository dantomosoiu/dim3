\begin{abstract}
%Provide a concise summary of the design of the application
This report details the design and implementation of Berserker Chat --
a web-based instant messenger and file sharing application which allows many users to
collaboratively chat and share files. Berserker Chat is built using the Django Web Framework [1]
which is written in the Python programming language.

\end{abstract}

\section{Aim of Application}
The main aim of the application is to provide a service which allows users to communicate with each other in a real-time
chat environment, not dissimilar to other chat applications which the user may have used before.

\subsection{Goals and Objectives}
\label{sec: goals}
The main goals and objectives are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Anonymous use of the application to chat with others in public chat rooms
\item Ability for a logged-in user to have a private chat with another logged-in user
\item Public chat rooms based on category/interests, e.g. public chat room for users interested in photography
\item Creation of public chat rooms based on interest which allow other people to find the created room, join and chat
\item Ability for file sharing between users -- files are uploaded and can be downloaded by other users 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item	What is the purpose of the application?
\item	Eg. The application is an academic search engine called AcaSe and is it is based upon the PuppyIR Framework\cite{glassey2011framework}, which has been used to construct other such services\cite{glassey2010fifi,elliot2010fifi}. The main purpose of this web application is to provide a customized interface to services such as Google Scholar and MS Academic Search. 
\item	What are the assumptions about the aims and objectives?
\item	Describe the design goals and objectives of the application.
\item	What are the constraints of the project?
\item	Functionality List: i.e. what is the required and desired functionality?
\item	Reflective Questions: 
\item	Is the scope of the application appropriate? 
\item	Are the design goals realistic/achievable? 
\item	How complex is the application? 
\item	Is distribution across the web appropriate? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Draw a wireframe of the user interface
\item	this may require several wireframes depending on the complexity of the application and the interfaces
\item	Describe the user interface.
\item	i.e. Label key input and output components: describe them.
\item	Provide a Walkthrough and explain the user interactions with application. 
\item	i.e. use cases
\item	Describe the interactions associated with the dynamic components on the user interface.
\item	What calls are required to dynamically update the data on the client side?
\item	How does the user interface help the user achieve their goal, or complete their task? 
\item	Is the user interface intuitive, appealing, usable, etc?
\item	What technologies are used on the client side? 
\item	What are the reasons for your choices? i.e. what is the advantages and disadvantages of using this technology? 
\item	What other options are there? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Application Architecture}
The application is designed to use a 3-tier architecture as illustrated in the diagram below. Using this type of architecture allows
a separation of concerns between the display of the content on the client browser, the web application framework, and the backend.
The 3-tier architecture consists of: \\
\textbf{Client} \\
The client (user) interacts with the Berserker Chat application through a web browser\\ \\
\textbf{Middleware} \\
The middleware is where the Django web framework is positioned. It essentially glues together the client and the backend, providing views based on data contained within the database and also updating the database based on the interactions of the user at the browser interface level.\\ \\
\textbf{Database} \\
The database stores information about the models which can be requested by the middleware by an Object Relational Model request. The database is implemented using SQLite3.\\ \\

\begin{itemize}
\item	N-Tier Architecture Diagram %nearly done
\item	i.e. data flow diagram between the interface/client, middle ware, and backend services/data repos %nearly done
\item	Describe the data model i.e. what data needs to be stored or persisted by the application? %todo
\item	What are the relationships within the data model. %todo
\item	i.e. use ER diagram and explain. %todo
\item	Describe the backend services used (if any). %sqlite3 db to store...
\item	Reflective Questions: 
\item	How have you ensured that there is a separation of concerns? %used the mvc pattern equivalent of django: model view template MTV 
\item	What other technology could have been used instead of django? %php web frameworks: cakewalk, symphony. others: ruby on rails, spring 
\item	What are the advantages of using a Web Application Framework over other technology? %more structure perhaps over php for example; encourages a separation of concerns 
\item	And, what are the disadvantages? %development time could be longer if one is to maintain a clear structure. some web apps can be put together in a short space of time but violate the fundamental separation of concerns that is promoted by the Django web application framework
\end{itemize}

\section{Message Parsing}
\begin{itemize}

\item	On the architecture diagram, Identify and label the main messages that will be parsed through the application.
\item	or alternatively (and preferably) include sequence diagrams to denote the sequence of communications parse between clients and servers.
\item	Describe the messages that are parsed back and forth through the application.
\item	For the main transactions - describe the payload of the messages 
\item	i.e. What are the contents of the messages? i.e. include sample XML, XHTML, JSON, etc of one or two messages.
\item	What is the format of the messages? 
\item	Why this format? 
\item	What other formats could be used, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these other formats?
\end{itemize}
